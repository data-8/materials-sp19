You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",

    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. Your partner must be enrolled in the same lab as you are. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",

    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp19/staff.html).\n",

However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",

To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect.

    "The Nurses' Health Study (NHS) is another very large observational study which has brought many insights into women's health. It was begun in 1976 by Dr. Frank Speizer, with questionnaires that were mailed to 121,964 female registered nurses in the United States asking about their medical history, cholesterol and blood pressure, current medications, and so on (one of the benefits of studying nurses is their ability to give reliably accurate answers to these questions). The study's initial focus was on investigating the long-term health effects of oral contraceptives, whose use had become much more widespread in the U.S. during the 1960s, but the focus soon expanded to investigating a wide variety of questions on women's health. The NHS continues to this day, tracking its third generation of nurses in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most consequential early findings from the NHS was about hormone replacement therapy (HRT): supplementary estrogen and progesterone for post-menopausal women to relieve side effects of declining hormone levels due to menopause. The NHS found that HRT in postmenopausal women was negatively associated with heart attack risk. In a landmark 1985 paper in the *New England Journal of Medicine* (NEJM), Speizer and his coauthors wrote that\n",
    "> As compared with the risk in women who had never used postmenopausal hormones, the age-adjusted relative risk of coronary disease in those who had ever used them was 0.5 (95 per cent confidence limits, 0.3 and 0.8; P = 0.007)... These data support the hypothesis that the postmenopausal use of estrogen reduces the risk of severe coronary heart disease. [(Stampfer et al., 1985)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4047106)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the authors are saying that women on HRT are half as likely to suffer a heart attack over a certain time period. We'll define the term \"relative risk\" later in this section, and we'll also investigate the interpretation of these claims and their statistical basis."
