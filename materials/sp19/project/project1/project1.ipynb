    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Friday 3/1. Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late; a project submitted less than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, a project submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit, and a project submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must also complete the first 8 questions and submit them by 11:59pm on Friday 2/22. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; your partner must be from your assigned lab section. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp19/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Response Questions:** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide. Check to make sure that you have a [Gradescope](http://gradescope.com) account, which is where the scores to the free response questions will be posted. If you do not, make sure to reach out to your assigned (u)GSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section, we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n",
