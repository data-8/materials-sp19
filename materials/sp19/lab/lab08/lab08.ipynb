    "By the [Central Limit Theorem](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/4/Central_Limit_Theorem.html), the probability distribution of the mean of a large random sample is roughly normal. The bell curve is centered at the population mean. Some of the sample means are higher and some are lower, but the deviations from the population mean are roughly symmetric on either side, as we have seen repeatedly. Formally, probability theory shows that the sample mean is an **unbiased estimate** of the population mean.\n",

In this section, we will quantify the [variability of the sample mean](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/5/Variability_of_the_Sample_Mean.html) and develop a relation between the variability and the sample size. For the remainder of this lab, we will use the abbreviation \"SD\" to refer to \"standard deviation.\"\n",
