    "The Therapeutic Touch (TT) is the idea that everyone can feel the Human Energy Field (HEF) around individuals. Certain practictioners claim they have the ability to feel the HEF and can massage it in order to promote health and relaxation in individuals. Those who practice TT have described different people's HEFs as \"warm as Jell-O\" and \"tactile as taffy\". \n",

Emily would be on the other side and would flip a coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to correctly answer which hand Emily put out. Overall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",
