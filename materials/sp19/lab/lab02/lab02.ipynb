    "* usually evaluates to a value.\n",

    "    3\n",
    "    5 - 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Description                                                   |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `abs`      | Returns the absolute value of its argument                    |\n",
    "| `max`      | Returns the maximum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `min`      | Returns the minimum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `pow`      | Raises its first argument to the power of its second argument |\n",

    "The expression `5 - 2` and the two call expressions given above are examples of **compound expressions**, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions.  `5 - 2` combines the expressions `5` and `2` by subtraction.  In this case, `5` and `2` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",
